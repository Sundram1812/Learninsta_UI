        answer:
          "Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design pattern where microservices communicate asynchronously by producing and consuming events. This approach allows for decoupled and scalable systems.",

          "<div><strong>How Event-Driven Architecture Works in Microservices:</strong></div><ul><li><strong>Event Producers:</strong> Services generate events when something significant happens (e.g., order placed).</li><li><strong>Event Brokers:</strong> Middleware components like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SNS/SQS transport events between microservices.</li><li><strong>Event Consumers:</strong> Other microservices subscribe to events and take action accordingly.</li><li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> Services do not directly depend on each other, improving scalability and flexibility.</li></ul>",
